## Run this app

- `stock-app-react`: `npm run dev`
- this is `tanstack-router` and more vanilla react patterns I am familiar with.
- modify `.env` with your API key.

## next version, but it is all AI generated

- I assume you don't want to just read the AI generated stuff, but this one is all done with AI since I am less familiar with nextjs.
- stock-app
